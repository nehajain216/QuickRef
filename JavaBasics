Enum:
Enum is used for setting pre defined constants (like- days of week, moths, planets of solar system and so on)
Enum cannot extends another class because it implicitly extends java.lang.Enum (and java doesnot support multiple inheritance)
we can have variables, constructor and methods inside enum  
Variables inside Enum are implicitly final static
